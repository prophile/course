Sod's law: in any given situation, frustration tends to its maximum possible value.

Programming: a useful definition

Abstraction:
  removing detail to expose the essential features of a particular concept or object

Object Orientation (and its counterparts)
Thinking OO
Programming Blocks
* Variables
* Logic
* Data Structures
* Methods

This is a theory lecture: important concepts

Programming: writing, testing, debugging/troubleshooting, and maintaining the source code of computer programs; a set of instructions to perform a specific task.

Pseudocode: fake code, written like english

Modularization(!)
* dividing a whole into well-defined parts
* can be built and examined separately
* test-driven development

Flavours

Procedural/Imperative
  (do this, do that, if this then do that)
  Object Orientation
    Everything is a Thing
    There are properties that a Thing has
    a class is a blueprint
    many instances of same 'blueprint'
    all with similar properties

Functional
  - more like mathematical functions
  - don't use mutable variables
  - basicaly stateless

Maths is statements of facts, CS is "do something".

DSs: Arrays, HashMaps
